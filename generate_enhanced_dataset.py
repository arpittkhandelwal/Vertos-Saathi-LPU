    ["Academic", "What is the grading system at LPU?", 
     "LPU follows a comprehensive 10-point CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) system to evaluate student performance. The grading scale ranges from A+ (Outstanding) to F (Fail). Here's the detailed breakdown: A+ grade requires 90-100% marks and carries 10 grade points, A grade needs 80-89% with 9 points, B+ requires 70-79% with 8 points, B needs 60-69% with 7 points, C+ requires 50-59% with 6 points, C needs 40-49% with 5 points, and F (Fail) is below 40% with 0 points. The CGPA is calculated using the formula: Sum of (Grade Points × Credits) divided by Total Credits. This system is internationally recognized and helps in higher education admissions abroad. Each course has assigned credits based on teaching hours."],
    
    ["Academic", "How can I check my attendance?",
     "You can check your attendance through the UMS (University Management System) portal.Follow these steps: 1) Visit the LPU UMS portal at https://ums.lpu.in 2) Login with your Registration Number and Password 3) Navigate to 'My Attendance' section in the main menu 4) Select the semester you want to view 5) Your attendance will be displayed subject-wise with percentage. The portal shows both theory and practical attendance separately. You can view attendance for current and previous semesters. Attendance is updated regularly by faculty members after each class. LPU mandates a minimum of 75% attendance to be eligible for end-term examinations. If you fall below this threshold, you need to apply for condonation through the proper channel with valid medical certificates or genuine reasons. The system also sends automatic email alerts when your attendance drops below 80%. Parents can track attendance through the ERP portal. For any discrepancies, contact your class coordinator or faculty member immediately with proper proof of attendance."],
    
    ["Academic", "When are the semester exams?",
     "LPU follows a bi-semester academic calendar with two major examination cycles annually. The End-Term examinations are conducted in November-December for the Odd Semester (July-December session) and in April-May for the Even Semester (January-June session). The exact dates are announced 30 days in advance on the UMS portal and official website. Mid-Term examinations are typically held in September for Odd Semester and February-March for Even Semester. The academic calendar follows this structure: Odd Semester starts in July/August with classes running until November, Mid-Terms in September, End-Terms in November/December, followed by winter break. Even Semester begins in January with classes until April, Mid-Terms in February/March, End-Terms in April/May, followed by summer break. Supplementary/Re-appear examinations for students with backlogs are conducted in June-July. The complete academic calendar including exam schedules, holidays, and important dates is published on the university website at the beginning of each academic year. Students should regularly check UMS portal for updates and time-table announcements."],
    
    ["Academic", "What is the credit system?",
     "LPU follows a comprehensive Credit-Based Choice System (CBCS) as per UGC guidelines. Credits represent the weightage of a course based on contact hours and importance. The credit distribution is: 1 credit for 1 hour of theory lecture per week, 1 credit for 2 hours of practical/lab work per week, and 1 credit for 2 hours of tutorial per week. For example, a typical theory course with 3 hours of lectures per week carries 3 credits, while a lab course with 4 hours of practical might carry 2 credits. To earn a degree, students must complete minimum required credits: BTech requires approximately 160 credits, MBA requires 60-72 credits. Credits are earned only when you pass a course with minimum 40% marks in both theory and practical components separately, plus overall 50% aggregate. Failed courses don't contribute to earned credits and must be repeated. The credit system allows students to progress at their own pace - you can take extra credits to graduate early or spread courses over more semesters if needed. Elective courses provide flexibility to choose from multiple options. Transfer of credits from other universities is possible subject to approval and equivalence. Your CGPA is calculated based on grade points and credits: CGPA = Σ (Grade Points × Credits) / Σ Credits."],
    
    ["Academic", "How do I apply for re-evaluation?",
     "If you're not satisfied with your examination results, you can apply for re-evaluation within a strict timeframe. Here's the complete process: 1) Application Window: Re-evaluation applications must be submitted within 10 working days from the date of result declaration. No applications are accepted after this deadline. 2) Fee Payment: Pay the prescribed fee of Rs. 1,000 per subject through the UMS portal using credit card, debit card, or net banking. 3) Submission Process: Login to UMS portal, go to 'Examination' section, click 'Apply for Re-evaluation', select the subject(s), pay fee online, and download acknowledgment receipt. 4) Processing Time: Re-evaluation results are typically declared within 30 days of application. 5) Scope of Re-evaluation: The answer sheet is checked for addition of marks on each page, transfer of marks to title page, any unevaluated portion or question, and proper marking scheme application. However, re-evaluation does NOT include re-checking of subjective evaluation quality or allocation of grace marks. 6) Result: Your marks may increase, decrease, or remain same after re-evaluation. If marks increase, the difference is added; if they decrease, original marks are retained with no negative impact. Updated marks are reflected in your grade sheet. 7) Further Options: If still not satisfied, you can view your answer script by paying Rs. 500 per subject and can apply for challenge evaluation. For any queries, contact the Examination Department."],
    
    ["Academic", "What is the passing criteria?",
     "LPU has specific passing criteria that students must meet for each course. The comprehensive requirements are: 1) Minimum Marks: You must obtain at least 40% marks in BOTH theory and practical components separately. For example, if a course has 60 marks theory and 40 marks practical, you need minimum 24 marks in theory AND 16 marks in practical independently. 2) Overall Aggregate: In addition to separate minimums, you must score at least 50% marks in the overall course (theory + practical + internal assessment combined). For instance, in a 100-mark course, you need 50 marks overall. 3) Internal Assessment: Most courses have 20% marks for continuous internal assessment through assignments, presentations, quizzes, and attendance. Regular participation is crucial. 4) Attendance Criteria: Minimum 75% attendance is mandatory to appear in end-term exams. Without this, you cannot sit for exams regardless of your academic performance. 5) Grade Point: To pass a course, you must earn at least grade C (40-49% marks) which carries 5 grade points. Grade F indicates failure. 6) Backlog/ATKT: If you fail a course, it becomes a backlog and you must clear all backlogs to be eligible for final year examinations and degree completion. 7) Maximum Duration: You have limited chances to clear a course -typically 3 attempts. 8) Aggregate CGPA: To be awarded the degree, you need minimum 5.0 CGPA overall across all semesters. Meeting these criteria ensures you progress smoothly through your program."],
